## Riot

As of June 10, 2023, [RIOT](https://www.riotplatforms.com/) Blockchain has a
total hash rate output of 10.5 EH/s. This is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of
the current total hash rate of the Bitcoin network, which as of June 8th was
~430 EH/s.

Their current facility located in Rockdale, TX supports up to 750MW, with a
[new 1 GW mining facility](https://www.riotplatforms.com/bitcoin-mining/corsicana)
announced in Corsacana, TX. You can
[review their Q1 '23 presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_cf5a89cf93925ee05f36045195f58e16/riotblockchain/db/447/4252/pdf/Riot_Investor+Presentation+%283.24.2023%29+%281%29.pdf)
here to get a better understanding of their large scale operations.

## Marathon

As of June 10, 2023, [Marathon Digital](https://www.mara.com/) Holdings has a
total hash rate output of 15.2 Eh/s. This is approximately 3.5% of the total
network hash.

They have over 9 mining facilities in South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana and Texas
and they are building 1 facility in Abu Dhab, UAE that is still under
development. They are aiming to have a total hashrate of 23 EH/s by mid 2023.

## CleanSpark

As of May, 2023 [CleanSpark Inc.](https://www.cleanspark.com/), has deployed a
fleet of about 67,196 units for a combined hash output of 6.7 EH/s putting them
at 1.5% of the total network hash.

CleanSpark currently has 5 facilities, 4 located in the state of Georgia and 1
in New York. With a new facility in Sandersville, GA this will add another 6EH/s
of production.

## Cipher

As of June 10, 2023, [Cipher Mining](https://www.ciphermining.com/) has a
[total hash rate output of 6 EH/s](https://investors.ciphermining.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cipher-mining-announces-may-2023-operational-update)
from facilities in Odessa, Happy, and near Andrews, TX. This accounts for about
1.4% of the total network hashing power.

Based on their recent announcements, they have plans to bring move up to 8.2
EH/s by end of 2023.

## Hut 8

Located in primarily in Canada, [Hut 8](https://hut8.io/digital-asset-mining/),
has 3 main facilities Medicine Hat, AB, Drumheller, AB and North Bay, ON for a
total of approxiamtely 4 EH/s capacity. However
[they recently merged with US Bitcoin Corp](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-and-us-bitcoin-announce-merger-of-equals-to-create-a-preeminent-digital-asset-mining-hosting-managed-infrastructure-operations-and-high-performance-computing-organization-883351656.html)
that had a total capacity of 5.6 EH/s givin the merged companies a total of
approxiamtely 9.6 EH/s. This is about 2.2% of the total hashpower.

US Bitcoin Corp has facilities in Texas, New York, and Nebraska.

## Terawulf

Terawulf has 2 facilities, 1 located off the shores of Lake Ontario in New York,
and the other in Pennsylvania for a total capacity of 5.5 EH /s.

Terawulf is uniquely 100% carbon neutral deriving a large portion of their power
from Nuclear power as one of the first Bitcoin operations to utilize Nuclear for
power generation.

## CoreScientific

https://corescientific.com/digital-asset-self-mining/

[Core Scientific’s self-mining operations](https://investors.corescientific.com/investors/news/news-details/2023/Core-Scientific-Announces-May-2023-Production-and-Operations-Updates/default.aspx)
produced 1,314 bitcoin in May. As of month end, the Company operated
approximately 143,000 bitcoin miners, accounting for approximately 69% of its
total number of miners and representing a total potential self-mining hash rate
of 14.9 EH/s.

As of month-end, the Company operated approximately 209,000 bitcoin miners for
both colocation and self-mining, representing a total potential hash rate of
22.1 EH/s at its data center facilities in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina,
North Dakota and Texas.

## Mining Marketplaces

NiceHash and mining pools like AntPool or Foundry have different but
complementary roles within the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

NiceHash is a cryptocurrency mining marketplace. In other words, it's a platform
where individuals can buy or sell hashing power. Hashing power is the computing
power that miners use to generate new blocks and confirm transactions on a
blockchain.

Here's how NiceHash works:

Miners with spare computational power (hashing power), often from GPU or
ASIC-based mining rigs, connect to NiceHash. NiceHash's software auto-selects
the most profitable coin to mine based on the hardware you're using and current
market conditions. This mined cryptocurrency isn't necessarily Bitcoin—it's
whichever coin is the most profitable at the time. Buyers who want to mine a
specific coin but don't have the hardware (or don't want to manage it) can pay
to use your hardware to mine their chosen coin. Now, let's talk about mining
pools, like AntPool or Foundry. These are groups of miners who pool their
computational resources together to mine cryptocurrencies more effectively. The
rewards are then distributed among the pool members based on the amount of
computational power each contributed, which is known as their 'hashrate'.

Here's where the interaction happens:

When a buyer on NiceHash purchases hashing power, they must specify a pool to
mine with that power. So, they could choose to direct this power to a pool like
AntPool or Foundry. The purchased hashing power is then used to mine
cryptocurrency on that pool, and any rewards gained from this mining process go
to the buyer (after NiceHash takes a small fee). In other words, NiceHash acts
as a kind of broker, allowing people to buy and sell hashing power, and the
actual mining takes place in the pools that the buyers specify. This system
allows people to participate in mining who may not have the hardware or
technical knowledge to do so on their own, while allowing those with spare
computational power to profit from it.

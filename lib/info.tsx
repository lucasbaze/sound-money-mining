      We believe that sound money creates the right <b>incentive structures</b>{" "}
      for sustainable human development across the planet.
      <br />
      <br />
      When money is hard to create and requires true work to generate, people
      are incentived to make high quality long term decisions. Thus you
      naturally get more <b>stable economies</b>, more{" "}
      <b>realiable infrastructure</b>, and <b>thriving environments</b> for
      humans and the planet.
      <br />
      <br />
      As Bitcoin is the first working solution to digital, sound money, our
      vision is create an entry point for anyone to invest, educate, and support
      developments within the Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining community.
